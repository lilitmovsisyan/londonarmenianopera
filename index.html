                    London Armenian Opera was founded in September 2011 with the aim of performing stage music with
                    
                    particular emphasis  on promoting operas of Armenian origin. Our inaugural project was the first UK
                    
                    production of the much loved 'Anoush' opera by Armen Tigranian, which was performed at the Tabernacle,
                    
                    Notting Hill, on 6th/7th July 2012, and repeated on 27th/28th October 2012 due to popular demand.

                    Our second production, 'Garineh', a comic opera by Tigran Chouhajian, was once again performed
                    
                    at the Tabernacle on 29th/30th March 2014 and was equally successful, both nights being a total sell-out.

                    Our third production, 'Davit Bek', was the grand heroic opera by Armen Tigranian, and was performed
                    
                    at the Britten Theatre, Royal College of Music, on 18th/19th December 2015, to commemorate the centenary
                    
                    of the Armenian genocide.

                    Our fourth production was the UK premiere of 'Fire Ring', a modern opera by Avet Terterian, which was
                    
                    performed at the Arcola theatre, London E8 3DL, on July 31st and August 1st 2016, in association  with the
